# About us

BedrockLegends is a Minecraft Community Network created and founded by Grotts & MysteriousEmpire, This network was created around a Family Friendly environment. We strive to provide wholesome family friendly servers and community while also providing a challenge. We center around packs that are typically more difficult or have harder difficulty settings. Hardcore on some servers can be unforgiving but we have provided a reasonable means to avoid permanent death entirely. We also hope to keep our community as drama free as possible, a place to come hang and chill with friends and not worry about the stresses of everyday life. I hope you feel this is a fit for you.
